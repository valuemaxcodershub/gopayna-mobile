# Copilot Instructions for gopayna

## Project Overview
- **gopayna** is a multi-platform Flutter application (mobile, web, desktop) for payments and financial transactions.
- The main Dart code is in `lib/`, with one file per feature or screen (e.g., `buy_airtime.dart`, `dashboard.dart`).
- Platform-specific code is in `android/`, `ios/`, `macos/`, `linux/`, `windows/`, and `web/`.

## Architecture & Patterns
- **Entry point:** `lib/main.dart` initializes the app.
- **Feature separation:** Each major feature has its own Dart file in `lib/`.
- **API integration:** `lib/api_service.dart` handles backend communication.
- **Settings & config:** `lib/app_settings.dart` and `analysis_options.yaml` for lints.
- **Assets:** Located in `assets/` and referenced in `pubspec.yaml`.

## Developer Workflows
- **Build:** Use `flutter build <platform>` (e.g., `flutter build apk`, `flutter build web`).
- **Run:** Use `flutter run` for local development.
- **Test:** Place tests in `test/` and run with `flutter test`.
- **Analyze:** Run `flutter analyze` to check for lint and type errors.

## Conventions & Practices
- **Naming:** File and class names are lower_snake_case for files, UpperCamelCase for classes.
- **No custom state management:** Uses Flutter's built-in state management unless otherwise noted.
- **Lints:** Uses `flutter_lints` (see `analysis_options.yaml`).
- **No business logic in UI:** Keep logic in service/helper files (e.g., `api_service.dart`).

## Integration Points
- **Backend:** All API calls go through `api_service.dart`.
- **Platform assets/config:** See `android/`, `ios/`, `web/manifest.json`, etc.
- **Generated code:** Some files in `build/` and platform folders are auto-generated by Flutter tools.

## Examples
- To add a new feature, create a new Dart file in `lib/` and link it in `main.dart`.
- To add a new API call, extend `api_service.dart`.
